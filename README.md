There are basic commands to work with mongoDB using <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/set.mongodb.php">MongoDB PHP driver</a>.

I've implemented simple examples how to:
  - make a connection,
  - create collections,
  - create/delete indexes,
  - make CRUD operations,
  - work with GridFS,
  - import the dataset from a json file into MongoDB.

Note, that you must run <b>"composer update"</b> to use MongoDB PHP driver.
